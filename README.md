# beppler

Beppler is my spring-postgres-graphql playground I created to set up a JAVA sprint project with , as you guessed, postgres and GraphQL.

I've used Insomnia to create a collection of queries/mutations.

This badboy is ready to chuck some front-end applications in and have all the power of a JAVA and GraphQL back-end.
